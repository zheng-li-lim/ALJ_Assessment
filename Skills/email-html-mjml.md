description: Responsive HTML email template generation using MJML 4.x framework. Use when the user asks to create, generate, design, or build an email template — including welcome emails, promotional blasts, transactional templates, newsletters, or any responsive email. Also use when the user asks to compile MJML to HTML, work with or edit existing MJML templates, or troubleshoot email rendering issues across clients.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires Node.js 14 or later for npx mjml compilation. Install MJML per project (npm install -D mjml). Works with Claude Code and Claude.ai.

# email-html-mjml — Responsive Email Developer

Generate valid, cross-client MJML 4.x templates and compile them to production-ready HTML. The primary goal is compatibility: Outlook (2013–365), Gmail (web/app), Apple Mail, and major mobile clients. Every output must be compilable with `--config.validationLevel=strict` and survive Gmail's 102KB clip limit.

## Workflow

1. **Gather requirements** — Infer email type, brand colors, and content from the user's message and conversation context. Ask only for what is genuinely missing and blocking progress (e.g., no colors provided and the layout has branded sections). Never front-load a questionnaire.
2. **Plan layout** — Decide and announce the structure before writing code (single-column, 2-col grid, hero + content, etc.)
3. **Load component references** — Read the relevant file(s) from the Component Index below before writing any MJML
4. **Generate MJML** — Write complete, valid MJML starting from `<mjml>` with a full `<mj-head>`
5. **Compile** — Follow `compilation.md`. Run `npx mjml` with `--config.minify=true`
6. **Deliver both files** — Always output `.mjml` source AND compiled `.html`

## 9 Engineering Rules

1. **Structural Integrity** — All visual content MUST be in `<mj-column>` inside `<mj-section>`. Sections cannot be nested.
2. **Responsive Defaults** — Assume 600px width. Use `<mj-group>` to prevent mobile stacking for side-by-side elements (social bars, logo rows).
3. **Outlook Compatibility** — Use `<mj-font>` for web fonts (prevents Times New Roman fallback). Always provide a fallback stack (Arial, sans-serif). For `<mj-section>` background images, always set both `background-size` and a fallback `background-color`.
4. **Gmail Optimization** — Use `inline="inline"` on `<mj-style>` for custom CSS. Prefer component attributes (`color`, `font-size`) over CSS classes for critical styles.
5. **Dark Mode** — Include dark mode support when explicitly requested or when the email has a light background that would cause harsh forced-inversion. See the Dark Mode Pattern below.
6. **Accessibility** — Every `<mj-image>` MUST have `alt`. Always set `<mj-title>` (populates `aria-label`). Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA 4.5:1 contrast. For heading roles, use `mj-html-attributes` — direct `role`/`aria-level` attributes on `mj-text` are illegal under strict validation (see Accessibility Checklist below).
7. **Styling Efficiency** — Use `<mj-attributes>` with `<mj-all>`, component defaults, and `<mj-class>` to eliminate repetitive inline styles.
8. **Hero Sections** — Use `<mj-hero>` for full-bleed hero banners; it falls back to a regular section in unsupported clients. Avoid `<mj-accordion>` and `<mj-carousel>` — client support is too poor to be useful.
9. **Templating Support** — Wrap dynamic tags (Handlebars/Liquid) in `<mj-raw>` to protect them from the MJML parser.

## Critical Gotchas

**Outlook:**
- Background images: VML only generated for `<mj-section>` and `<mj-hero>` — nowhere else
- Background positioning: keyword values only (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) — pixel values ignored
- Always pair `background-repeat="no-repeat"` with explicit `background-size`
- Font fallback: `<mj-font>` hides `@font-face` from Outlook via MSO conditional comments

**Gmail:**
- Use component attributes for critical layout — CSS classes may be stripped
- 102KB clip: always compile with `--config.minify=true`

**iOS / Android stacking:**
- Always compile with `--config.minify=true` — removes whitespace between `inline-block` columns
- Whitespace between tags causes stacking even inside `<mj-group>`

**Vertical-align bug:**
- If any column in a section sets `vertical-align`, ALL columns in that section must explicitly set it

**JavaScript:**
- JS is completely blocked in all email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, iOS Mail). No `onclick`, no clipboard API, no interactivity of any kind. Interactive-looking elements (copy buttons, toggles) are purely decorative.
